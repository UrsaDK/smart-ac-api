# Design Overview

Building the Smart AC prototype can be subdivided into the following tasks:

  - [provide an admin interface to the API](./backend-admin.md)
  - [build the API for multiple AC clients](./backend-api.md)
  - [document required API for the AC clients](./ac-client.md)

These tasks correspond to individual directories above, and I will go through all of them, one at a time, detailing my recommended approach, identifying any potential issues, and raising all the questions I've encountered.
